## First Week Tips

### Day 1-2: Test Everything
- Send yourself test emails to verify forwarding
- Try replying from aliases to test functionality
- Check spam folders in case emails get filtered

### Day 3-4: Start Using for Real
- Use aliases for new newsletter subscriptions
- Try aliases on low-risk websites first
- Keep notes of which alias goes with which service

### Day 5-7: Develop Habits
- Create naming conventions (e.g., `service.category@provider.com`)
- Update your password manager with alias information
- Set up email filters to organize forwarded emails

## Common First-Week Issues

### Emails Not Arriving
**Solution**: Check your spam folder first. Add the alias provider to your safe senders list.

### Can't Reply from Alias
**Solution**: Make sure reply support is enabled in your provider settings. Some free plans don't include replies.

### Forgot Which Alias Goes Where
**Solution**: Use descriptive names like `amazon.shopping@provider.com` instead of random strings.

### Overwhelmed by Options
**Solution**: Start with just 2-3 aliases for different categories (shopping, newsletters, social media).
