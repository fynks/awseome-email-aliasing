## Days 1-2: Test & Verify

**Goal**: Make sure your aliases work perfectly before relying on them.

### Essential Tests

#### Test 1: Basic Forwarding
1. **Send yourself an email** to your new alias from another account
2. **Check your main inbox** - email should arrive within 1-5 minutes
3. **Look for any filtering** - check spam/promotions folders
4. **Verify sender appears correct** - should show your alias, not your real email

#### Test 2: Reply Functionality (If Available)
1. **Reply to the forwarded email**
2. **Check the "From" field** - should show your alias
3. **Send to yourself** from the alias
4. **Confirm recipient sees alias** - not your real email

#### Test 3: Multiple Aliases
1. **Create 2-3 different aliases** with descriptive names
2. **Test each one separately**
3. **Ensure no cross-contamination** - emails go to correct places
4. **Try different email types** - text, HTML, with attachments

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Emails Going to Spam
**Problem**: Forwarded emails landing in spam folder
**Solution**: 
- Add your alias provider's domain to safe senders
- Add specific aliases to your contacts
- Check your email client's spam settings

#### Reply Shows Real Email
**Problem**: When replying, recipients see your actual email
**Solution**: 
- Check provider settings for "reply from alias" option
- Some free plans don't support replies
- Consider upgrading to paid plan

#### Slow Delivery
**Problem**: Emails take too long to forward
**Solution**: 
- Normal delay is 1-5 minutes
- Check provider status page for outages
- International emails may take longer

### Day 1-2 Checklist
- [ ] Send test email to each alias
- [ ] Verify forwarding works within 5 minutes
- [ ] Test reply functionality if available
- [ ] Add alias domains to safe senders
- [ ] Check spam folders and adjust filters
- [ ] Create 2-3 aliases with descriptive names

### Naming Conventions

```

#### Category System (Alternative)
```

#### Date-Based System (For Temporary)
```

```

### Best Practices for New Signups

#### Before Creating Each Alias
1. **Choose a descriptive name** you'll remember in 6 months
2. **Check if you already have** an alias for this type of service
3. **Consider the service's reputation** - trustworthy companies first
4. **Plan for organization** - how will you categorize emails?

#### During Signup
1. **Use the alias everywhere** - don't mix with your real email
2. **Keep notes** in your password manager about which alias you used
3. **Save important emails** that come to aliases
4. **Monitor for confirmation emails** in your main inbox

### Day 3-4 Checklist
- [ ] Create aliases for 3-5 new signups
- [ ] Use descriptive naming convention
- [ ] Start with low-risk services only
- [ ] Update password manager with alias info
- [ ] Monitor forwarded emails carefully
- [ ] Keep notes on what aliases are used where

## Days 5-7: Organize & Optimize

**Goal**: Build sustainable systems for long-term alias management.

### Email Organization Strategies

#### Option 1: Gmail Filters
```
Create Filter:
- To: shopping.*@provider.com
- Apply Label: "Shopping"
- Skip Inbox (if desired)
- Mark as Important
```

#### Option 2: Outlook Rules
```
Create Rule:
- If sent to: newsletter.*@provider.com
- Move to: "Newsletters" folder
- Mark as read (optional)
```

#### Option 3: Provider-Level Organization
Many alias providers offer:
- Built-in categorization
- Automatic sorting rules
- Color coding for different alias types

### Alias Management System

#### Create an Alias Inventory
Track your aliases in a simple spreadsheet or note:

| Alias | Used For | Created Date | Active | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------|-------|
| amazon.shopping@... | Amazon account | Jan 15 | ✅ | Primary shopping |
| tech.newsletter@... | Tech newsletters | Jan 16 | ✅ | Weekly digests |
| trial.software@... | Software trials | Jan 17 | ✅ | Delete after trials |

#### Regular Cleanup Routine
**Weekly**: Review new aliases and usage
**Monthly**: Clean up unused or expired aliases
**Quarterly**: Review naming conventions and organization

### Advanced Setup (Optional)

#### Custom Domains (Paid Plans)
If your provider supports custom domains:
1. **Purchase a domain** ($10-15/year)
2. **Configure DNS settings** (provider will guide you)
3. **Create aliases** like `anything@yourdomain.com`
4. **Benefit**: Full control and professional appearance

#### Integration with Password Managers
Most password managers can store:
- Which alias was used for each account
- Notes about the purpose of each alias
- Categories for different types of services

#### Backup Strategy
1. **Export alias list** from your provider (if available)
2. **Keep notes** in multiple places
3. **Have a backup provider** ready in case of issues
4. **Maintain access** to your real email as fallback

### Week 1 Mistakes to Avoid

#### Using Random Names
**Wrong**: `abc123@provider.com`
**Right**: `netflix.streaming@provider.com`
**Why**: You'll forget what the random string was for

#### Using One Alias Everywhere
**Wrong**: `general@provider.com` for all services
**Right**: Different alias for each service/category
**Why**: Defeats the purpose of tracking and organization

#### Not Testing Replies
**Wrong**: Assuming you can reply from all aliases
**Right**: Test reply functionality for each important alias
**Why**: You might get locked out of accounts if you can't reply

#### Forgetting to Update Password Manager
**Wrong**: Password manager still shows old email
**Right**: Update all entries with new aliases immediately
**Why**: You'll forget which alias goes with which account

### Day 5-7 Checklist
- [ ] Set up email filters/rules for organization
- [ ] Create alias inventory/tracking system
- [ ] Test organization system with real emails
- [ ] Clean up any test aliases no longer needed
- [ ] Set up backup/export if available
- [ ] Plan next week's alias strategy
